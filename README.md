### 🔬About me
I take a `creative approach` to engineering.

Because I've always believed that `thinking outside the box` is the most useful trait of an engineer.

In my opinion `interest` and `desire to create` are keys to success, so I use them as force to move on.

- I'm currently focused on working with micrcontrollers platforms such as **STM32**.
- I chose that line of work because it gives you freedom in developing devices from scratch.
